A booking website that has inputs of ID, First and Last Name, Email, Username, and Passsword.
People who are students and faculty members can book times. If their ID is not in the database (or unrecognized ID), then they are given a 404 upon entering the website (or login).
If an admin is logging into the website (boolean), they can see who all is in the database, as well as see who has rooms booked and can manually add/delete any bookings if needed (extreme cases).

The basics is getting a name tied with an ID and room number (1-6). Then further progression will be the time/duration of booking, email, and UID.
